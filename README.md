# OWS (Open Web Service)
OWS is an open standard implementation of web service infrastructure. It decouples devops from both hardware and vendor. Think "Open Source AWS minus the actual hardware".

## Motivation
Every web service vendor has their own web service concepts, feature set, UI, etc. As an engineer, learning to use a web service creates an implicit vendor lock-in. An open standard means that everyone only needs to learn 1 tool. 

## Analogies
OWS is to Datacenters as Android is to smartphones as Windows is to PCs (operating system)
OWS is to AWS as Windows is to MacOS (software/hardware coupling)
OWS is to Linux as AWS is to Windows (free vs proprietary)
